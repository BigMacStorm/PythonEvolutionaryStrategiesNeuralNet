# PythonEvolutionaryStrategiesNeuralNet
A evolutionary strategies neural network written in python which will hopefully be modular enough to be loaded into many different python projects as a submodule.

Want to create a simple python plug-in-able library I can impliment some ideas from https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/ in, which I could then load into simple mechanic systems.
